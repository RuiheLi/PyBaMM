    "The SPM consists of two spherically symmetric diffusion equations: one within a representative negative particle ($\\text{k}=\\text{n}$) and one within a representative positive particle ($\\text{k}=\\text{p}$). In the centre of the particle the standard no-flux condition is imposed. Since the SPM assumes that all particles in an electrode behave in exactly the same way, the flux on the surface of a particle is simply the current $I$ divided by the thickness of the electrode $L_{\\text{k}}$. The concentration of lithium in electrode $\\text{k}$ is denoted $c_{\\text{k}}$ and the current is denoted by $I$.
